# ALS-for-Movies-Recommendation
This task uses PySpark's ALS algorithm to train a recommendation model on the 20 Million Movie Ratings dataset. By tuning parameters such as rank, regularization, and iterations, the model's performance is evaluated using RMSE. Visualizations show how error varies with these parameters, and the model generates personalized movie recommendations.
