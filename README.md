# ALS-for-Movies-Recommendation
## This task uses PySpark's ALS algorithm to train a recommendation model on the 20 Million Movie Ratings dataset. By tuning parameters such as rank, regularization, and iterations, the model's performance is evaluated using RMSE. Visualizations show how error varies with these parameters, and the model generates personalized movie recommendations.
### Assignment from SGH
Task:
Train and run the model on the 20 Million movie ratings dataset instead of the 1 Million one.

Test with various values of:
ranks
regularization parameter
number of iterations
Compare the models and find the best model based on the error value (i.e RMSE).

Prepare a table with at least 10 of your own ratings for the movies that you select and run the model with this data as input and show the top 20 movies that the model recommends for you to watch.
